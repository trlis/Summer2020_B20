CUSTOM CLASSES

String class:
			   Data/ Attributes:   text, index

			Actions/ Functions :    charAt(); substring(); indexOf(); lowerCase(); upperCase(); - methods



Car class:

           Data/ Attributes:      Color, Brand, year, Model, mileage       - given by using instance variables

           Actions/ Functions:    start, stop                              - given by using instance methods


Class decides what objects can be created it from

When you create a class in order to use a class you need to create an object

When we have a string class we create an object by giving string literals
When we need to use an ArrayList class we create an object

So the class is where you objects are came from

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A CLASS is an entity that determines how an object will behave and what the object will contain

A CLASS is a blueprint or set of instructions to build a specific type of object

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OBJECT must come fom the class
An OBJECT is an INSTANCE of the class

An object can store data. The data stored in an objects are commonly called fields

Objects share all the data attributes from the class

We can create a class without object
    BUT
We CAN NOT create on object without the class


    (class)Car: -entity that determines the objects(objects(instance of the class) created from the class)
    For one object we can give multiple data (value):
                                                       (object)car: (data) Tesla, model X, white
                    Brand:
(object)car1:  (data) Mercedes (1 copy of the brand)
        car2:         BMW      (2 copy of the brand)
        car3:         Audi     (3 copy of the brand)
       .....

 INSTANCE VARIABLE : object variables  (belongs to the object)
                     declared outside the method
                     each object has its own copy of instance variables

  By declaring instance variable we will be able to store different value to those variables every time we create new object
  We can call the instance variable through the objects

  Instance methods(objects' methods)
                                    - can be called through the obj. name):
                                    - does not have static. If the method contains static it's not an instance method
