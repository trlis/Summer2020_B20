 Static variable: we only use if fit has one common feature that can be shared by all objects of the class.


 Instance variable : -we only use it if there is not one common feature and each for each copy more different copies needed
                     -If we want each object has the unique data

                     When we declare static variable


                     Types of variables:

                     Local variable: Declared within the method or within the block. Accessible only within the method/block.
                                     Not accessible outside of it.
                                     Local variable has to be initialized before use.

                     Instance variable: Declared outside methods or blocks.
                                        Declaration: int b;
                                        Instance variable has default value. Can be used without initializing
                                        Can be accepted only in instance variable
                                        Shared by the object


                     Static Variable: Declared belongs to the class.
                                      Only Static variable can be called in the static method.
                                      Static variable - global variable - can be accepted in the static and instance methods
                                      Shared by the class.

                                      Adv.: Can be called through the class name.
                                            All the objects have the same data



        STATIC METHOD   VS    INSTANCE METHOD


       Static method:                                                     Instance method:

       Can not accept instance variable. Only static                      Each object has own copy
                                                                          Has instance attributes
                                                                          Accepts static variables as well as instance variables
                                                                          Belongs to the objects

       Static members:

       static variable *
       static method *
       static initializer block *
       static class


       STATIC INITIALIZER BLOCK

       -runs first, regardless of what
       runs once ss soon as

       -How we declare static block :

       static(keyword){

       }

       -Why do we need it?

       Main purpose: initializing static variable

       There will be situations when static variables and initialization takes more than one step


       Static import: imports the static variable and static method

            import.packageName.className.*// imports all the class members from the class
            import static packageName.className.staticName; // imports the specific static member from the class
