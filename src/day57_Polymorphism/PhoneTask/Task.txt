Warmup task:
    1. create an interface named Downloadable:
            abstrct method: download();
    2. create an interface named AndroidApp that can inherit from Downloadable
            variable: AppStoreName

    3. create an interface named AppleApp that can inherit from Downloadable
            variable: AppStoreName
    4. create an abstract class named Phone
            instance variables: brand, model, price, size
            abstract methods: texting(), calling()
            add constructor that can initialize the fields
            if the price is set to negative, the system should throw an exception with a message of:
                    Invalid Price, cannot be negative
    5. create a class named iPhone that can inherit from AppleApp and Phone
            actions: texting(), calling(), faceTiming()
            if the price of Iphoen is more than 1500, the system should throw an exception with a message of:
                    Invalid Price, Iphone' price cannot more than 1500
    6. create a class named Samsung that can inherit from AndroidApps and Phone
            actions: texting(), calling(), freezing()
             if the price of Samsung is more than 1200, the system should throw an exception with a message of:
                    Invalid Price, Samsung' price cannot more than 1200
Abstraction:
        1. shape
        2. animal
        3. car
        4. phone
IS A relation:

            class extends class
            class implements interface
            interface extends interface
            class extends class implements interface(s)
