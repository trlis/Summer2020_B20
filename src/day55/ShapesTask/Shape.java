/*
task01:
    1. create an abstract class called Shape
        attributes:
            name(static), area, perimeter, hasVolume(static), volume
        abstract methods: calculateArea(), calculatePerimeter, calculateVolume()
                            return-types: double



    5. create the following sub classes of shapes:
                Square
                Triangle
                Cude
                ...
                and repeat the same steps
    6. create a class called shape objects:
            create objects of each shapes and calculate thier area, perimeter, and volume
    HINT: Math.PI will give you the actual value of PI
