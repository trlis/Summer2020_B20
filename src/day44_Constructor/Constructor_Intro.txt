CONSTRUCTOR

Regular method declaration:

	   Access-modifier   Specifier   ReturnType   methodName (parameters) { statements }


Constructor is a very special method. Used whenever we need to create an object of the class

		    A                 obj          =      new          A();
		class name        obj. name             keyword    Constructor


Every class must mave a constructor. Without the constructor we can not have any class at all.
If we dont create one, compiler creates constructor for us by default

The only time the compiler creates a Constructor by default when you did not create it by yourself.

When I create a CONSTRUCTOtR
Then Compiler does not create a default CONSTRUCTOR

When I do not create a CONSTRUCTOtR
Then Compiler creates a default CONSTRUCTOR for me.



Class can not exist without the constructor.
Object can not exist without the class.

Constructor declaration:

	Access-modifier  (no return type / no specifier) name has to be same with the class name ( parameters ) {}

	Access-modifier className(parameters){}




We can create as many objects as we want
Create object from the class:

	ClassName obj = new Existing constructor

Execution of the constructor epends on the creation of object.
If object is not created  the CONSTRUCTOR will NOT be executed



Summary

	- Constructor is a special method that every class MUST have
	- Constructor is used when we create the object of a class
	- We can use constructor to initialize the object's instance variables
	- Execution of a constructor ALWAYS depends on the object
	-CONSTRUCTOR IS A SPECIAL METHOD THAT MATCHES THE NAME OF THE CLASS AND HAS NO RETURN TYPE


	NO-ARGUMENT CONSTRUCTOR:
		A constructor that has no parameter is known as a default constructor.
		If we do not define a constructor in a class, then compiler creates a default constructor(with no argument) for the class.

	PARAMETERIZED CONSTRUCTOR:
		A constructor that has parameters is known as a parameterized constructor.
		If we want to initialize fields of the class with our own values, then we pass the parameters to the constructor
